<h1>Hello, we're Newhouse.</h1>

<p>
Here at Newhouse, we believe every idea deserves a new house. Not a clean, polished house — but a messy new house. A new house that's never complete. A new house that hums at midnight and never locks its doors.
<br><br>
In our new house, nothing stays still. Chairs become ladders, tables become stages, and closets are full of whiteboards. Our new house doesn’t ask “why,” it asks “why not.” It's what makes Newhouse, Newhouse.
<br><br>
Sometimes, the power goes out in the new house. That’s okay. We light it up with glowing screens and wild thoughts. Someone’s always pacing, someone’s always laughing, and someone’s always saying, “This new house needs more fire.” And so we give it more.
<br><br>
We’re not building a company. We’re just living in this new house. But most importantly, our new house isn't just a house. It's a home.
<br><br>
<b>Welcome.</b>
</p>
